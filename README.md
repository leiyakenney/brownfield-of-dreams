# Brownfield Of Dreams

Brownfield of Dreams is a Mod 3 Back-End Ruby on Rails application project at Turing School of Software and Design. This project is designed to have students work off brownfield code, enhancing an already-existing codebase for housing video tutorials for online learning. Each tutorial is a playlist of video segments. 

Within the application, an admin is able to create tags for each tutorial in the database. A visitor or registered user can then filter tutorials based on these tags. A visitor is able to see all of the content on the application but in order to bookmark a segment they will need to register. Once registered, a user can bookmark any of the segments in a tutorial page.

Throughout the course of this project, we enhanced the abilities of three different users - admin, logged in users, and visitors to the site. With this, we limited what non-logged in users had access to (certain videos, bookmarking features, and friending features), and limited what non-admin users had access to (editing/deleting existing tutorials).Â
